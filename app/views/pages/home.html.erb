          <h2>the problem</h2>
          <p>30% of restaurants fail in their first year; another 30% in the next. starting a restaurant is hard, real hard. food trucks aren't much easier. cheaper? yes. but at 50-100K a pop, we're still talkin' about serious cash.

          <h2>the solution</h2>
          <p>acceler<em><span color="#e67e22">EAT</span></em> was conceived to make food creation more accessible. we know that there are thousands of great chefs and aspiring restauranteurs out there – we want you to be making the world a tastier place!

          <h2>how it works</h2>
          <p>come cook for us! pitch your restaurant idea and our founders will decide whether to sponsor it. if you're selected, we'll pay you and two sous chefs a salary, in exchange for truck revenue. incubation periods range from 3-9 months. meanwhile, we're hustlin' on the side for you, in order to obtain permits, source your ingredients, and begin setting up a standalone business to be operated when your time here winds down.
